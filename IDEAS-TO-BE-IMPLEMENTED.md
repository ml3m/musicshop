Based on the provided `MainMenu` class and overall structure of your music shop
application, here are some recommended functionalities and features that could
enhance the system, followed by a brief explanation of each:

### 1. **Enhanced User Authentication & Authorization**
   - **Description**: Add roles and permissions management for users, allowing
     fine-grained access control. This could include adding methods to restrict
     certain functionalities based on user roles, and a login timeout mechanism
     for security.
   - **Implementation**: Extend `AuthenticationService` to include permission
     checks, and possibly add `RolePermissionMapping` logic.

### 2. **Wishlist or Favorites Feature for Customers**
   - **Description**: Allow customers to maintain a list of their favorite
     albums or instruments. This feature would be useful for marketing, user
     retention, and user experience.
   - **Implementation**: Add a new model `Wishlist` or extend `Customer.java`
     and add methods in `UserService`.

### 3. **Order History & Status Tracking ~ Update Order Status command**
   - **Description**: Maintain a comprehensive order history for each customer,
     including order status (e.g., `Pending`, `Shipped`, `Delivered`). This
     improves the customer's user experience and helps track sales data more
     effectively.
   - **Implementation**: Modify `Order.java` to include `status` and
     timestamps. Add methods in `OrderService` to fetch order history and
     update statuses.

### 4. **Search Filters with Advanced Criteria**
   - **Description**: Enhance the search feature by adding more filters like
     `Genre` for albums, `Brand` for instruments, and other relevant fields.
     This makes searching for items more efficient and user-friendly.
   - **Implementation**: Extend `SearchCriteria.java` and add corresponding
     logic to `InventoryServiceImpl`.

### 5. **Reports Generation with Export Capabilities**
   - **Description**: Add functionality to generate various reports (e.g.,
     sales report, inventory summary, revenue reports) with the ability to
     export to different formats (CSV, PDF).
   - **Implementation**: Extend `AnalyticsService` and implement logic for
     exporting data. Optionally, use libraries such as Apache POI or a PDF
     generation library.

### 6. **Inventory Alerts and Notifications**
   - **Description**: Provide alerts for low stock or when new items are added.
     Notifications can be sent to the admin or specific roles.
   - **Implementation**: Add a notification module in `services` to handle
     stock alerts, potentially using listeners or scheduled tasks.

### 7. **Integration with Payment Gateways**
   - **Description**: Integrate with popular payment gateways to handle order
     payments securely and efficiently.
   - **Implementation**: Create a `PaymentService` interface and possible
     implementations for different gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).

### 8. **Discounts and Promotions System**
   - **Description**: Add functionality to apply discounts and promotions to
     orders. Promotions can be time-based, quantity-based, or user-specific.
   - **Implementation**: Create a new model `Promotion.java` and integrate
     logic within `OrderService`.

### 9. **Logging & Auditing Mechanism**
   - **Description**: Introduce logging for critical events (e.g., user login,
     inventory changes) and audit trails for security purposes.
   - **Implementation**: Use Java logging frameworks (like SLF4J) or
     third-party solutions (like Log4j) and integrate with relevant services.

### 10. **Bulk Upload & Management for Inventory Items**
   - **Description**: Allow admin users to perform bulk upload of inventory
     items using files (CSV, Excel).
   - **Implementation**: Extend `InventoryService` to parse and process files
     uploaded through a dedicated user interface.

### 11. **Customer Review and Rating System for Items**
   - **Description**: Allow customers to leave reviews and rate albums or
     instruments. This feature can increase customer engagement and provide
     useful feedback.
   - **Implementation**: Create a `Review.java` model and integrate with the
     user interface.

### 12. **Data Backup & Restore Functionality**
   - **Description**: Implement backup and restore capabilities for the
     database, ensuring data resilience and integrity.
   - **Implementation**: Add methods in `FileStorageService` to backup data at
     intervals and restore as needed.
